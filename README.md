# High-Low Game

## Introduction
The Guess the Number game is a simple yet engaging Python project designed to help you practice control flow and Boolean logic. Through several rounds of gameplay, you'll predict whether your assigned number is higher or lower than a number generated for the computer. Each correct guess earns you a point, making this game a fun way to sharpen your Python skills.

## How to Play
1. **Generate Numbers**: Each round, the game generates two random numbers between 1 and 100—one for you and one for the computer.
2. **Make Your Prediction**: You will see your number, but the computer's number remains hidden. Your task is to predict whether your number is higher or lower than the computer's.
3. **Scoring**: If your prediction is correct, you earn a point. If not, no points are awarded. The game continues for a predetermined number of rounds.
4. **Final Outcome**: After all rounds are complete, your total score is displayed, along with a message that reflects your performance.
